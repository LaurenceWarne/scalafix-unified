# scalafix-unified

Set of opinionated scalafix rules to unify your codebase

## Why?

First of all, because I wanted to write a scalafix rule :)

Second, I find discussions about such basic things like `Nil` vs `List()` vs `List.empty` unproductive. But on the 
other hand it is nice to have codebase unified as it was written by a single person.
